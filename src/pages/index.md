          Hi, I am Petr and I started the Polkadotters community with my
          colleague Pavel. We are from Czechia, a small country in the heart of
          Europe. We are really pleased to be a part of this initiative because
          we believe that the community should be the one with power over the
          network!

          At PromoTeam we believe that validation is a philosophical
          contribution. Acting as your voice in the network and means of
          collaborating with the community. We believe that the validation role
          goes beyond just producing blocks and have constant uptime.

          As a developer, I often like to look "under the hood". Polkadot is
          said to be a bet against blockchain maximalism, that’s why we united
          independent community-led initiatives around the world under one
          Alliance, so let’s jump on this exciting journey together!

          Hey, I’m Patrick from Germany and I’m representing pathrocknetwork and
          MillenniumClub or MCLB. We are running several validators for
          different projects and protocols and I am so happy to be able to join
          the alliance of like-minded validators where we share similar goals
          and values.
